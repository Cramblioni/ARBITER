# ARBITER-simple-proto2i
the transition thing between SMPLE proto2i and it's successor ARBITER

##ARBITER [not an acronym for anything yet]
the renamed version of SMPL(Simple MultiProcessing Language)[renamed for name clashes with pre-existing shtooff]

	history/backstory
Based on the Fx language used in the game "Bert Higgins : Man From H.E.L.L" [https://archive.org/details/BertFull], FX was a 
multi-paradigm language built from a process orientated approach to object orientation. Objects ran asynchronously and 
couldn't contain references to eachother, instead relying on invoking and awaiting/responding to events. the developers behind 
fx(the one used with bert higgins) went on to begin developing fx2 which morphed into a language called 
AMPL (advanced multiprocessing language)  which never went further than early test and a reference sheet.

After talking with the lead developer of the languages mentioned for hours through the thinking and theory behind this neato 
approach, i decided that it would be worthwhile making my own iterpretation. I took some liberties with syntax, since fx/fx2/ample
were assembler based and require pre defined code bank (as in each code bank was "compiled" and the executer would create objects
that used the "compiled" code as needed). ARBITER gets it's name from a special object type in fx called "arbiters" which were a 
wierd mix bbetween a watchdog and software inturrupt generator.I used the name Arbiter to reference the enviroment the code is 
executed in, and i made the language interpreted.

	Terminology
ARBITER :: name of the language
Arbiter :: the enviroment the code is executed in
process :: a block of code being executed [the word "object" doesn't fit these, it's meaning refers to something slightly different]
variable space :: the dictionary variables are stored in
uses/using ... :: refers to the code the process is execute (the code originates from a bank so it's "using" that bank)
